# Glorious grammar pedantry

Because it's the difference between knowing your shit, and knowing you're shit :=)

## Slide: Exercise 1

* Please include the protocol in the repo URL (needs https://)


## Slide: What's a assertion

* What's wrong with the title of this slide? :=)
* s/a/an
* iff = if and only if (spell in full, just in case)

## Slide: Other kinds of tests

* I would have found it useful to have some code examples of diff tests, doctests and coverage tests in the slide, primarily to be able to "recognise" them in code
* What metric would you use instead of percent coverage? (you had a strong answer for this, worth including)

## Slide: Python code for property based testing

* Recommend making the point that this is testing the _properties_ of the sort function

## `pbt101.py` file

* The example of reverse order isn't clear `[::-1]` if you don't have fluency in Python syntax
